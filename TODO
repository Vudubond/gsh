Annex instantiates hooks before you get them so they are effectively
singletons. This makes having hooks that gather output/stats not particularly
useful to be loaded by Annex. Currently you can get around this by
Instantiating your own plugin and passing it into Hooks but I should enable
a way to return some kind of response object via the hooks system.
